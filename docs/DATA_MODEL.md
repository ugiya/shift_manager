## 1. The three layers

Data lives in three forms; know which one you're touching.

| Layer | What | Where |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Input** (`*In`) | The editable "requirements document" the client holds and POSTs. Pydantic models. References by **id**. | `backend/app/requirements.py` |
| **Domain** | Immutable Timefold problem facts + planning entity. Built from input by `to_dataset` + `build_schedule`. | `backend/app/domain.py`, `backend/app/data.py` |
| **Output** (payload) | JSON the frontend renders: dataset payload, score breakdown, flags, carry-over seed. | `backend/app/serialize.py`, `backend/app/solver.py`, `backend/app/carryover.py` |

Flow: `RequirementsIn` → `validate_requirements` → `to_dataset` (→ `Dataset`) →
`build_schedule` (→ `Schedule` of `Seat`s) → solve/score → `dataset_payload` + score + flags + `next_carryover`.

---

## 2. Domain entities (`backend/app/domain.py`)

Problem facts are **immutable** (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`). IDs are the stable keys;
names are display only.

- **Site** (`:29`) — `id, name`. A physical location.
- **Role** (`:35`) — `id, name`. A skill (e.g. Developer, QA). No built-ins.
- **Team** (`:41`) — `id, name, site_id`. **A team belongs to exactly one site.**
- **Project** (`:48`) — `id, name, team_ids: frozenset`. **A project may run under one or
  more teams** (ADR-0003), and since each team is at one site, a multi-team project spans
  sites. `ProjectIn.teams` (input) is the list form.
- **ShiftType** (`:55`) — `id, name, is_night, start_hour (0-23), end_hour (0-23)`.
  `end_hour <= start_hour` ⇒ the shift crosses midnight. Reusable, date-independent.
- **Employee** (`:64`) — `id, name, team_id, role_ids: frozenset, project_ids: frozenset,
  can_manage`, plus `avoid_shift_ids: frozenset` (shifts they'd rather not work),
  `unavailable_dates: frozenset[date]` (dates they can't work — see eligibility below),
  `preferred_shift_type_ids: frozenset[str]` (preferred shift TYPES — drives R11), and
  the **carry-over** fields `carryover_burden, worked_last_weekend, prev_shift_end, prev_shift_was_night`.
  An employee is in **one team**, holds **roles**, and (as a worker) belongs to **projects** within that team.
- **Shift** (`:85`) — `id, shift_type, team_id, site_id, start_dt, end_dt`. A ShiftType
  on a concrete date for one team at one site. Derived: `is_night`, `start_date`,
  `is_weekend` (keys off the **start** day; weekend = Fri/Sat per config).
- **Seat** (`:114`, the **planning entity**) — one required position to fill:
  - *worker seat* = (Shift × Project × Role), or *manager seat* = (Shift × Team).
  - `kind ('worker'|'manager'), shift, team_id, project_id, role_id`.
  - `eligible: list[Employee]` — the **value range** (only these may fill it).
  - `employee: Optional[Employee]` — the **planning variable**, nullable
    (`allows_unassigned=True`) ⇒ best-effort: a seat may be left unfilled.
  - Derived: `is_burden` = the shift is night or weekend.
- **Schedule** (`:140`, the **planning solution**) — `employees, shifts, seats, score`.

**Seat materialisation & eligibility** (`backend/app/data.py:build_schedule` `:234`):
for each demand row, for each selected weekday in the week, create the Shift, **one
manager seat** (eligible = team members with `can_manage`, `:230`), and **one worker
seat per (project, role, count)** (eligible = employees who have that project in
`project_ids`, that role in `role_ids`, **and are in the seat's own team**
(`employee.team_id == seat.team_id`, ADR-0003), `:226`). **Unavailability:** an employee
whose `unavailable_dates` contains the shift's `start_date` is **removed from that seat's
`eligible`** (worker *and* manager, `:226`/`:234`), so the solver never assigns them then.
The solver never assigns outside `eligible`; a manual override outside it — including
staffing a cross-site project's seat from another site, or assigning someone on an
unavailable date — is an **Exceptional Assignment** (see §4).

Stable id formats: shift `shift-{team}-{shiftType}-{date}`; manager seat
`seat-{shift_id}-mgr`; worker seat `seat-{shift_id}-{project}-{role}-{n}`.

---

## 3. Input model (`backend/app/requirements.py`)

`RequirementsIn` (`:111`) = `{sites, roles, shift_types, teams, projects, employees,
demand, week_start}`. The sub-models (`SiteIn, RoleIn, ShiftTypeIn, TeamIn, ProjectIn,
EmployeeIn, DemandIn`) mirror the domain but reference by id and use input-friendly
field names (e.g. `ShiftTypeIn.start/end`, `TeamIn.site`, `ProjectIn.teams`).

- **DemandIn** (`:80`) — `team, shift_type, days: [weekday names], crew: {project: {role: count}}`.
  Demand is **exact**: each required position is one seat; an unfilled seat is
  understaffing (a Compromise). `week_start` defaults to the seed week.
- **Carry-over shape is single-sourced** as `CarryoverFields` (`:87`) — the four fields
  `{carryover_burden, worked_last_weekend, prev_shift_end, prev_shift_was_night}`. A
  contract test pins `EmployeeIn`, the seed output, and the frontend types against it.
- **HR metadata** on `EmployeeIn` (round-trip only): `status` (`active`|`on-leave`|`inactive`),
  `employee_number, email, phone, hire_date, notes`. Only `status == "active"` employees are
  materialised by `to_dataset` and counted in coverage warnings; inactive/on-leave people
  stay in the roster (and export) but are never scheduled. The domain `Employee` does NOT
  carry HR metadata — it's an input/export concern. Because status must never affect the
  solve, **non-active rows also don't count against `MAX_EMPLOYEES`** (which bounds problem
  facts) — only `active` employees do; total roster size is bounded by `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`.
  The "no role and cannot manage — unusable" warning is **active-only** for the same reason.
  A manual override naming a non-active employee is **rejected** (not made Exceptional) with
  a "not active" error, since inactive people cannot be scheduled even exceptionally.
- **Unavailability** on `EmployeeIn`: `unavailable_dates: list[str]` (strict ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`;
  `_bad_date` rejects non-canonical forms). Each entry is validated as a real date (a bad value
  is a blocking error); `to_dataset` converts them to the domain `frozenset[date]`. A date
  **outside the scheduled week is retained but inert** (it only affects the week it falls in) —
  intentional, so a client can keep a persistent roster of future leave. Coverage warnings are
  **availability-aware**:
  besides the structural "No employee can fill {role} on {project}", a date on which *every*
  otherwise-eligible worker/manager is unavailable yields an "everyone … is unavailable on
  {date}" / "no available shift manager on {date}" warning.
- **Preferred shift types** on `EmployeeIn`: `preferred_shift_type_ids: list[str]` (each must
  reference a known shift type — an unknown id is a blocking error). A **non-empty** set means
  "I prefer these types"; being assigned any *other* type is a soft Compromise (R11, a PENALTY
  — never a reward). Empty ⇒ no preference. `to_dataset` converts to the domain `frozenset[str]`.
- `validate_requirements` returns `(errors, warnings)`; `to_dataset` converts to `Dataset`.

---

## 4. Scoring model (`backend/app/constraints.py`, `backend/app/solver.py`)

Timefold is the **scoring authority**; `analysis.py` produces the human-readable
**flags** and MUST mirror `constraints.py` exactly (pinned by `tests/test_rule_parity.py`
and `test_score_authority.py`).

**Score type: `HardMediumSoftScore`** (three levels, each strictly dominates the next):
- **HARD** — physical/legal impossibilities. Any hard violation = *Infeasible*.
- **MEDIUM** — **demand coverage** only. Sits above all soft rules so coverage can never
  be sacrificed for a soft preference.
- **SOFT** — the preference/fairness rules.

Two orthogonal axes in the rule registry (`constraints.py:28`): `kind` (domain taxonomy:
`hard`=Infeasibility, `soft`=Compromise) vs `level` (score level: `hard|medium|soft`).
They usually match; the deliberate exception is coverage (`kind=soft`, `level=medium`).

**The rules** (plain English — the codes are just the ids in `constraints.py`):

| Code | Meaning | Level |
|------|---------|-------|
| **R1** | One person can't work two overlapping shifts at once | hard |
| **R2** | At least one day off per week | hard |
| **R3** | Minimum legal rest gap between any two shifts (incl. across the week boundary via carry-over) | hard |
| **R4** | Meet staffing demand — an unfilled required seat is understaffing | **medium (coverage)** |
| **R5** | At most one shift per calendar day | soft |
| **R6** | Long recovery after a night shift (incl. across the week boundary) | soft |
| **R7** | Don't work two weekends in a row | soft |
| **R8** | Prefer a second day off (working 6 days is discouraged) | soft |
| **R9** | Fairness — spread night/weekend "burden" shifts evenly (cumulative across weeks) | soft |
| **R10** | Respect "I'd rather not work this shift" preferences | soft |
| **R11** | Honor a "prefers these shift types" preference — assigning a non-preferred type is penalised (a PENALTY for an unmet preference, never a reward; empty preference set = no penalty) | soft |
| **EXC** | Exceptional Assignment — someone placed outside their normal role/project/team eligibility (or on a date they're **unavailable**); only via a manual override, needs sign-off. When the cause is unavailability, `analysis.py` names the date in the flag detail. | soft |

`score_breakdown` (`solver.py:60`) returns `{score, hard_score, medium_score, soft_score,
feasible (=hard>=0), constraints:[{name, rule, kind, level, match_count, score}]}`.

Tunables in `backend/app/config.py`: `LEGAL_REST_MINUTES` (8h), `NIGHT_REST_MINUTES`
(24h), `WEEKEND_WEEKDAYS` ({Fri,Sat}), the soft weights, and the resource caps
(`MAX_SEATS`, `MAX_EMPLOYEES`, `MAX_CARRYOVER_BURDEN=1000`, `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, `MAX_SOLVE_SECONDS`).

---

## 5. Carry-over across weeks (ADR-0002) — `backend/app/carryover.py`

Schedules are **continuous**: an accepted week seeds the next. The four carry-over
fields on each employee drive R3/R6 across the boundary, R7, and R9. See
`docs/adr/0002-schedules-are-continuous-across-weeks.md` for the full decision; do not
re-derive it from memory.

- **Out:** `/api/solve` and `/api/validate` return `next_carryover`, a self-describing
  envelope `{source_week_start, target_week_start, source_feasible, employees:{id: {the
  four fields}}}` (`carryover.carryover_seed`).
- **Back in:** the client submits that envelope as the optional request field
  `carryover_seed`; `apply_carryover_seed` rejects a non-empty seed whose
  `target_week_start` is missing or ≠ the requested week, then merges it.
- **Continuity across a leave (status interaction):** `next_carryover` only emits entries
  for materialised (active) employees, so an employee inactive for a week is *absent* from
  it. `apply_carryover_seed` only overwrites employees present in the seed, so an absent
  employee's carry-over fields on the client's retained `EmployeeIn` are left untouched.
  Net effect: an employee's carry-over **freezes at its last value during a leave** (they
  accrue no new burden because they work nothing) and **resumes on reactivation** — no
  continuity loss, provided the client keeps the requirements doc (its source of truth).

---

## 6. Datetime contract (load-bearing)

**All schedule datetimes are local-naive** (no timezone), built via `datetime.combine`
in `data.py:_mk_shift`. `prev_shift_end` is the only datetime a client sends, so it
**must be local-naive too** — enforced at the API edge (`validate_requirements`) and in
`to_dataset` (`_naive_datetime`, raises on a tz-aware value, incl. a trailing `Z`).
Mixing aware + naive crashes the solver/score path; don't reintroduce it.

---

## 7. Output payload & API (`backend/app/serialize.py`, `backend/app/main.py`)

Endpoints: `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/requirements` (seed doc), `POST /api/build`,
`POST /api/solve`, `POST /api/validate`, `POST /api/export`, `POST /api/import`. Solve/validate
return `{errors, warnings, dataset, assignments, score, flags, next_carryover}`.

**Import / export** (`backend/app/portability.py`, Phase 5): `POST /api/export`
`{requirements, format}` → `{content, filename, lossy}`. `POST /api/import`
`{requirements, format, mode, content}` → `{errors, warnings, requirements}` (the merged doc,
or `null` on a parse error). Two formats:
- **JSON** — *lossless*: the full `RequirementsIn` document; import always replaces the whole
  document (any non-`replace` mode is ignored with a warning).
- **CSV** — *lossy* employee roster only: references (team/roles/projects/preferred shift
  types) written by **name**, internal `id` in **column 1**, `;`-separated multi-values.
  `avoid_shift_ids` and the carry-over fields are **not exported**. On a **replace** import (and
  for newly-added rows) they reset to defaults; on an **upsert** of a matched employee they are
  **preserved** from the existing record (the CSV only patches the fields it carries). Names with
  commas/quotes round-trip (CSV quoting); a name containing `;` cannot (it's the multi-value
  separator) and an **ambiguous (duplicated) reference name is a hard error** — the lossy roster
  assumes reference names are `;`-free and unique. The `id` column lets a round-trip match rows
  back exactly.

Import is **mode-pluggable** (`ImportMode`): `replace` (default), `upsert_by_id`,
`upsert_by_name` (matches by name, never rewrites the matched employee's `id`),
`replace_autocreate_refs` (replace + create any referenced role/shift-type/project/team that
doesn't exist — auto-created teams land under the first site; an auto-created project unions in
the team of every row that uses it). Duplicate upsert keys (in the base or the file) are
rejected. The merged document is validated through the normal `validate_requirements` flow
(reused, not duplicated); a structurally-valid import with validation errors is still returned
so the editor can surface them. An oversized upload is rejected before parsing.

`dataset_payload` (`serialize.py:9`) carries everything the UI needs to render ANY view
without more backend work: `sites, week_start, days[7], roles, teams, projects,
shift_types, employees, shifts (with team_id/site_id/date/is_night/is_weekend), seats
(with team_id/project_id/role_id/label/eligible_employee_ids)`, plus `assignments`
`{seat_id: employee_id|null}`. The frontend mirror of all these shapes is
`frontend/src/types.ts` — **keep it in sync**.

Because the payload is view-agnostic, the frontend offers four **view modes** over the same
data (Phase 6, frontend-only): **Site** (seat grid per team), **Project** (seat-centric,
aggregating a project's seats across teams/sites per ADR-0003), **Team** and **Employee**
(people-as-rows rosters). The "View by" selector orders them **Project · Team · Employee ·
Site** and defaults to **Project** (Round 2 #3).

**All four views are editable for assignments** (Round 2 #2/#4 — this *reverses* the original
Phase-6 "overrides only in the Site view" decision). Site & Project place people via a seat
dropdown (`SeatCell`); Team & Employee use a per-cell **seat-picker** (eligible seats first,
then exceptional). Every assignment override is **immediate** and re-validates the whole week
(the *who-fills-a-slot* edit kind). The **Project view additionally edits requirements** — per
`(team, shift_type, role)` crew **counts** (steppers) and which **days** the shift runs
(toggles), including reducing a project to **none** ("No requirements this week"). Those are
the *requirements* edit kind: they mutate the **draft** and take effect only on **Save**.

The editor (and the Project view's requirement controls) edit a **local draft** (Round 2 #1):
field edits do not rebuild or re-validate until the user clicks **Save** (Discard reverts; an
import / carry-forward / initial load resyncs the draft). Solve and Carry are gated while
there are unsaved edits, so a stale doc can't be solved. **Assignment editing is also paused
in every view while requirement edits are unsaved (or a rebuild is in flight)** — the Save
rebuild resets assignments, so editing one first would silently lose it. This is a
UI-interaction concern only — it does not change the data model, the scoring levels, or the
carry-over contract.

## 8. Planned / in-flight changes (NOT yet built — do not treat as current)

_All planned features through Phase 6 have landed and moved into the sections above._
New plans get added here first, then move up as they ship.
